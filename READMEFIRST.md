--------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two additional 'Readme' files in this repository.

They are labelled according to the two primary code files in the repository:
1. 'Readme_Calculation' - this pertains to 'Final_Calculation_(with code explanation).ipynb'

2. 'Readme_Visualisation' - this pertains to 'main.py'

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Files:
* 'Final_Calculation_(with code explanation).ipynb' contains the code from which the data used for 'main.py' was derived.
* 'visualisations.ipynb' is an additional .ipynb file used as an aid for data cleaning and visualisation planning. It is not necessary for running 'main.py'.

Enjoy!
