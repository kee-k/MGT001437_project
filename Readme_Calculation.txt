<Overview>
The code in the notebook is a comprehensive script for performing Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) using the Brightway2 framework and the Ecoinvent 3.9.1 database.

<Requirements>
To run the project, you need the following:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Brightway2 packages:
  - bw2data
  - bw2io
  - bw2calc
  - bw2analyzer
- Additional Python libraries:
  - matplotlib
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - seaborn
  - scipy

<Running the Application>
The project is divided into two parts:
1. Data Processing and Analysis: The code processes the raw data from the Ecoinvent database and performs the necessary calculations.

!!Note
- To execute the code, access to the Ecoinvent 3.9.1 database is required, which is not included in this repository due to licensing issues. 
- You must acquire this database separately and download the Ecoinvent 3.9.1 database from the official Ecoinvent website.

2. Results Export: The final results are exported to an Excel file for further analysis or reporting.

<Data Sources>
The data used in this dashboard is derived from the Ecoinvent 3.9.1 database and follows ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 standards for life cycle assessment.

<License and Acknowledgements>
This project utilizes data from the Ecoinvent 3.9.1 database and adheres to the relevant standards for environmental impact assessment.
